    // 'Count up' that must hit a certain threshold before a change in gravity direction can occur
    // Either:
    //  - New gravity direction must be held for X consecutive ticks before it can take effect (use instance EnumGravityDirection field to store current
    //    tick's new direction (without actually changing the direction). On the next tick, if it has the same new direction, increment the counter. If when
    //    updating, the counter is above its threshold, instead, reset the counter and actually change gravity. If we get a different new direction than we
    //    were expecting, reset the counter (and still don't actually change gravity).
    //     - Can we re-use the 'pendingDirection' field?
    //     - This approach has a problem that if two different new directions fight over the new direction (i.e. alternate each tick), the player can leave the
    //       current gravity field and maintain its effects forever.
    //  - Old gravity direction must not occur for X consecutive ticks before another direction can take effect. Similar to previous, but we increment the
    //    counter if the new direction is not the current direction, we don't care about the new direction being the same for X consecutive ticks, just so
    //    long as it isn't the current direction. If it is the current direction, then reset the counter to 0
    //  - A more complex solution could involve a separate counter for each direction. Increment the corresponding counter for each tick that a new direction
    //    is chosen, every other tick, decrement all counters if they're above zero. This could allow multiple directions to 'fight it out' instead of one of
    //    them being lucky to occur when the counter reached its maximum.
    //  - An even more complicated system could expand on this, whereby instead of storing just one pending direction, we instead store multiple and use the
    //    ordering of priorities of the gravity change attempts to assign 'points' to individual counters.
    private int reverseTimeoutTicks = 0; // 'Count up' or 'Timeout' both work fine, we just want to count ticks
